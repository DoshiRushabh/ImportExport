        International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.
        It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world.
        In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP).
        While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.

    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail4">
        \t - Case: Assuming that an ocean carrier or a freight consolidator offers an exporter $65 W/M (weight or measurement) for the shipment of 665 cartons of product DX. The specified weight is per 1,000 kg and measure is per cubic meter (m³). The gross weight of each carton is 10.5 kg and the dimensions are 0.45 x 0.30 x 0.30 m (LxWxH) which is 0.04 m³ per carton.\n
        \t - The consignment has a weight of 6,982.5 kg (i.e., 10.5 kg x 665) and a measure of 26.30 m³ (i.e., 0.04m³ x 665)\n
        \t - The freight cost by weight is: $65 x (6,982.5/1,000) = $ 453.86\n
        \t - The freight cost by measurement is: $65 x 26.30 = $ 1,729.00\n
        \t - The volume of product DX is large in relation to its weight; the freight cost by volume gives the carrier or the consolidator a higher revenue and thus the exporter pays $1,729,00\n

    <string name="mode_or_trans_title5">Air Freight</string>
    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail5">
        \t - Used for high value/low volume shipments.\n
        \t - Benefits of air freight:\n
            \t\t\t\t - Faster delivery\n
            \t\t\t\t - Better security\n
            \t\t\t\t - Less packaging\n

    </string>
    <string name="mode_or_trans_title6">Calculating Airfreight</string>
    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail6">
        \t - The basis of calculation of airfreight charges is normally weight per kilo, the weight being rounded off to the nearest higher 0.5 kg. When the ratio between weight and measurement exceeds 6, however (in the UK, it is 5), the basis for calculating cost will be on volumetric weight.\n
        Example:\n
            \t\t\t\t - A 9.8 kg package – volume 40 cm3 = charged at 10.0 kg\n
            \t\t\t\t - A 9.8 kg package – volume 75 cm3 = charged at 75/6 = 12.5 kg\n
        \t - Chargeable Weight for a shipment is the greater of the actual weight and the volumetric weight. It is proper and customary for the figure to be rounded up to the next 0.5 kg.\n

        \t - Total volume = 1059576 + (535600X3) = 2666376 cubic centimeter\n
        \t - Total chargeable weight = 2666376 / 6000 = 444.396kgs\n
        \t - Here in shipment No: 1, the gross weight is 750kgs and chargeable weight is 444.396kgs. Hence, actual gross weight of 750kgs (which is greater) is charged airfreight.\n

        \t - Here in shipment No:2, the gross weight is 850kgs and chargeable weight is 1142.25kgs. Hence, airfreight is charged on the basis of chargeable weight of 1142.25kgs.    </string>

        \t - Advance\n
        \t\t - Under Export:-\n
                 \t\t\t\t - Supplier can call advance payment for export. The export is required to be made with one year time period. If the same could not be done, advance can be returned to buyer with interest at LIBOR prevailing on date of refund plus 2%. Seller is allowed to send documents directly to buyer in case of 100% advance received.\n
                 \t\t\t\t - LIBOR IS LONDON INTERBANK OFFERING RATE


        \t - At sight (L/C) / DP (Document against payment) / CAD (Cash against document)\n
           \t\t - Purpose for all above is same. Under this term documents are delivered to buyer against payment only.\n
           \t\t - DP vs. DAP\n
                \t\t\t\t - Term ‘DP’ must not be used as ‘DAP’. ‘DP’ is a payment term and ‘DAP’ is shipping term.\n
           \t\t - CAD (Cash against document)\n
                \t\t\t\t - It is an old usage.\n
                \t\t\t\t - This is still commonly used.\n
           \t\t - Risk involved (Under collection document under CAD)\n
                \t\t\t\t - Buyer may or may not release documents\n

        \t - Usance / DA (documents against acceptance)\n
             \t\t - Here some Credit period is allowed for payment to buyer. Under this buyer accepts bills of exchange to pay on maturity date. i.e. some days from date of shipment / bill of lading or invoice or exchange or any fixed date as agreed etc.\n
             \t\t - Under DA documents\n
                \t\t\t\t - Bank presents bills of exchange to buyer. Buyer signs bills of exchange in token of acceptance to pay on due date. Bank deliver documents to buyer.\n
             \t\t - Risk involved (under collection document)\n
                \t\t\t\t - This is very high risk. Bank has no responsibility to pay if buyer refuses to pay. Bank merely will hand over bill of exchange to seller for their furtherance. \n
                \t\t\t\t - As far as risk is involved, this is not at all recommended for new exporter.\n

        \t - Deferred (more than one type or types)\n
             \t\t - An arrangement in which the buyer is allowed to make partial payments i.e. more than one time in future dates.\n
             \t\t - For example :\n

    <string name="IMPORT_DOCUMENTATION_title14">How to calculate Assessable Value</string>
    <string name="IMPORT_DOCUMENTATION_detail14" formatted="false">
	\t -   a.   Ex-Works : 
 		  This is the value of the goods at the factory gate at origin \n
	\t -   b.   FOB (Free on Board)  : 
		  This value is the ex-works value + charges at origin upto loaded on vessel / aircraft. Such origin charges include local transportation, customs clearance charges and  handling at origin port / airport   \n
	\t -   c.   C &amp; F (Cost &amp; Freight) :
		  This value comprises of the FOB value + air / ocean freight upto the airport / port of  discharge.   This value does not include the landing charge at the port of destination.  \n
	\t -    d.   CIF (Cost Insurance Freight) : 
 		  This value comprises of the FOB value + air / ocean freight upto the airport / port of  discharge +   insurance cost for insurance of the goods upto the country of destination. The value does not include the landing charge at the port of destination.  \n
	\t -    e.    Assessable Value :  The customs duty in India is charged on the assessable value which is 1.01 CIF value.   
A standardized 1% landing charges are added to the CIF value for arriving at the assessable value.  If  any local commissions are payable by the importer to the indenting agent, such commissions are also to be added for arriving at the  assessable  
value.  Assessable value is calculated after  converting the foreign currency CIF value    into Indian Rupee at the current customs      
notified   exchange rate.     \n

	\t - If the air freight amount is not ascertainable or if the actual air freight is more than 20% of FOB,  then 20% of FOB is considered as air freight for calculation of CIF value.    \n
