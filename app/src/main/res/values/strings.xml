        International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.
        It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world.
        In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP).
        While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.
