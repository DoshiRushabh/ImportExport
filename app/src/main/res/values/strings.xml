        International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.
        It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world.
        In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP).
        While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.

    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail4">
        \t - Case: Assuming that an ocean carrier or a freight consolidator offers an exporter $65 W/M (weight or measurement) for the shipment of 665 cartons of product DX. The specified weight is per 1,000 kg and measure is per cubic meter (m³). The gross weight of each carton is 10.5 kg and the dimensions are 0.45 x 0.30 x 0.30 m (LxWxH) which is 0.04 m³ per carton.\n
        \t - The consignment has a weight of 6,982.5 kg (i.e., 10.5 kg x 665) and a measure of 26.30 m³ (i.e., 0.04m³ x 665)\n
        \t - The freight cost by weight is: $65 x (6,982.5/1,000) = $ 453.86\n
        \t - The freight cost by measurement is: $65 x 26.30 = $ 1,729.00\n
        \t - The volume of product DX is large in relation to its weight; the freight cost by volume gives the carrier or the consolidator a higher revenue and thus the exporter pays $1,729,00\n

    <string name="mode_or_trans_title5">Air Freight</string>
    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail5">
        \t - Used for high value/low volume shipments.\n
        \t - Benefits of air freight:\n
            \t\t\t\t - Faster delivery\n
            \t\t\t\t - Better security\n
            \t\t\t\t - Less packaging\n
            \t\t\t\t - Lower insurance\n
    </string>
    <string name="mode_or_trans_title6">Calculating Airfreight</string>
    <string name="mode_of_trans_detail6">
        \t - The basis of calculation of airfreight charges is normally weight per kilo, the weight being rounded off to the nearest higher 0.5 kg. When the ratio between weight and measurement exceeds 6, however (in the UK, it is 5), the basis for calculating cost will be on volumetric weight.\n
        Example:\n
            \t\t\t\t - A 9.8 kg package – volume 40 cm3 = charged at 10.0 kg\n
            \t\t\t\t - A 9.8 kg package – volume 75 cm3 = charged at 75/6 = 12.5 kg\n
        \t - Chargeable Weight for a shipment is the greater of the actual weight and the volumetric weight. It is proper and customary for the figure to be rounded up to the next 0.5 kg.\n

        \t - 80cm X 65cm X 103cm = 3 boxes\n
        \t - Total volume = 1059576 + (535600X3) = 2666376 cubic centimeter\n
        \t - Total chargeable weight = 2666376 / 6000 = 444.396kgs\n
        \t - Here in shipment No: 1, the gross weight is 750kgs and chargeable weight is 444.396kgs. Hence, actual gross weight of 750kgs (which is greater) is charged airfreight.\n

        \t - Here in shipment No:2, the gross weight is 850kgs and chargeable weight is 1142.25kgs. Hence, airfreight is charged on the basis of chargeable weight of 1142.25kgs.    </string>\n
